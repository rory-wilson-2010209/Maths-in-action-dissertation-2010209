The RDN code can be used for simulating the ABBCM with and without noise, and with and without RDN. This is also has some of the simple weight dynamics.

The 3D code simulates opinion changes twice and plots them on a 3D axis

The virality code emulates the virality model outlined in the paper

The SIRS model uses a stochastic algorithm and can changed to include bots
